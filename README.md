# Safe-Space-Stress-detection-
# üß† Per-Feature Explainable Multimodal Stress Detection and Feedback System

This project is a **real-time stress detection system** that leverages physiological, behavioral, and emotional modalities to classify stress and generate personalized natural language feedback using a locally-hosted LLM (e.g., Mistral-7B-Instruct).

## üì¶ Features

- Real-time fusion of:
  - **Heart Rate Variability (PPG from WESAD)**
  - **SpO‚ÇÇ (from BIDMC dataset)**
  - **Behavioral inputs** (Keystroke + Mouse activity)
  - **Facial Emotion Recognition** (FER-2013)
  - **Speech Emotion Recognition** (RAVDESS / TESS)
- **Tanh-normalized stress score** output in range `[-1, +1]`
- Final fused score mapped to:
  - High Stress
  - Moderate Stress
  - Non-Stress
- Natural Language **narrative feedback** generation using rules or LLM
